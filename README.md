# Cognizant Coding Task
# Technical Stack:
1. Kotlin (Language)
2. Android X Artifacts
3. MVVM Architecture with Data binding
4. Dagger2 (Dependency Injection)
5. Retrofit and OkHttp (Network)
6. RxJava, RxAndroid
7. Android Studio (Development Environment)
8. Added few Unit Test Cases.

# Technical Specification:
# Architecture:
The POC built on MVVM architecture with the help of data binding. Also, follows repository pattern. The repository design pattern provide abstraction layer between view model and network calls. Stricly follows Single Responsibility model and also segregated code and extracted business logic from view to provide more test coverage for business logic.

# Android Stack Used:
AppCompatActivity
ConstraintLayout
Expresso

#Known issues (Time constraint):
1. Few of the error cases are not handled.
2. Fewintegration tests are implemented.
